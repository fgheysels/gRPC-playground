# Introduction

This repository contains a little test project that I'm using to play around with gRPC services.
To learn more about gRPC, have a look at these websites or pages:

# About this test project

This test project consists of a C# solution which has a server and a client project.   The server exposes a gRPC service whereas the client simply consumes it.  The gRPC service definition is defined in a proto file and this file is shared between client and server.
